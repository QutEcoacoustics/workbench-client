<h1>Ethics Statement</h1>
<p>This website is run by the QUT Ecoacoustics.</p>

<p>
  If you are using this website to participate in a research student’s study,
  please refer to the ethics statement that was previously distributed to you.
  If you have not received an ethics statement from a research student, you
  should contact the

<h2>Principal Researcher</h2>

<p>The principal researcher for this project is Professor Paul Roe (QUT).</p>

<h2>Participation</h2>

<p>
  Your participation in this project is entirely voluntary. If you do agree to
  participate, you can withdraw from the project without comment or penalty.
  Personally identifiable information already obtained from you will be
  <strong>NOT</strong> destroyed. However, all contributed data will be
  anonymous to other users. Your decision to participate (or not), will in no
  way impact upon your current or future relationship with QUT.
</p>

<p>
  To participate create an account on the website. You can cease participation
  by deactivating your account on the website. When your account is deactivated,
  you can no longer log in, or make any changes. No other user will be able to
  see your identifiable information. Other contributions you may have made, such
  as adding annotations or tags, will be made anonymous and kept.
</p>

<p>
  Participation will involve interaction with several web pages. You can choose
  to stop participating at any time. The tasks will include activities like
  listening to audio on a web page, annotating that audio, and applying
  classification tags. Your participation in this project may involve
  interaction with content created by other participants on the website. This
  would occur by viewing the history of another participant’s activity on the
  website, annotating data, or as part of a list of suggested tags. The website
  may include competitive elements, such as a display of participants ranked by
  the amount of work each has completed up to that point in time.
</p>

<h2>Expected Benefits</h2>

<p>
  The goal of this project is to host, manage, and analyse environmental
  acoustic data. This project aims to benefit environmental research,
  particularly research into ecoacoustics. This can include studies of changes
  in particular environmental regions and evaluations of proposed development
  works on the environment. In this way, any participation on your behalf will
  go towards understanding the environment. Your participation may benefit you
  and other website users through the annotation, hosting, analysis, or
  visualisation of audio data.
</p>

<p>
  This website will not provide any financial benefit, any warranty on data, or
  any commitment to continued service.
</p>

<h2>Privacy and Confidentiality</h2>

<p>
  All comments, responses, and personally identifiable user contributed data
  will be treated confidentially. The actions that you perform to complete tasks
  on the website may be monitored, such as the buttons you click and the
  identifier of the recorded audio that is loaded. The monitoring is only for
  evaluating and improving the website, and will only be available to the
  research team.
</p>

<p>
  Any data collected as part of this project will be stored securely as per
  QUT’s management of research data policy.
</p>

<p>
  Please note that non-identifiable data collected in this project may be used
  as comparative data in future projects.
</p>

<p>
  If you are involved in a discovery or some other notable event, we may ask you
  for permission to publicly use your user name, real name, or both. This is
  entirely optional.
</p>

<p>
  If you fill out the <em>first name</em> and <em>surname</em> fields in the
  user profile, then your name may be used in automatically generated citations
  for audio data, annotation data, or other generated data sets that may include
  users in their citations.
</p>

<h2>Social aspects of the website</h2>

<p>
  Please note this website has been designed to have social aspects which
  deliberately share your username, profile picture, and a unique integer
  identifier. Users can access other user’s profiles and see basic summary
  statistics about other users.
