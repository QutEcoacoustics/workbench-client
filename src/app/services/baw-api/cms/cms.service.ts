 * Default CMS Pages
 * The workbench server has a set of well-known pages that always exist for important pages.
 * Since we always need to fetch these core pages we've defined their slugs in-app to save time.
 * These slugs changing will be considered a breaking change in the server.
 *
 * More dynamic pages may exist in the future, in which case the CMS API will be used to discover
 * what pages are available.
