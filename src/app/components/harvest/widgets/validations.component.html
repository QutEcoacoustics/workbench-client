      How to handle files which
      <span class="d-inline callout callout-warning">need attention</span>
    </h5>

    <p>
      A number of files have fixable problems. You can ignore these issues,
      however if you do, they will not be included in the final upload.
    </p>

    @if (hasError('noSiteId') || hasError('ambiguousDateTime')) {
      <p>
        Some files require more information from you. Ensure you have set the site
        and UTC offset for their folder.
      </p>
    }

    @if (hasError('missingDate')) {
      <p>
        Some files have missing dates. To fix, go back to the upload stage, and
        ensure their filenames include a
        <a target="_blank" [href]="filenameGuide | safe: 'url'">date</a>.
      </p>
    }

    @if (hasError('futureDate')) {
      <p>
        Some files have dates in the future. To fix, go back to the upload stage,
        and
        <a target="_blank" [href]="filenameGuide | safe: 'url'">
          rename the files
        </a>.

    <h5>
      How to handle
      <span class="d-inline callout callout-danger">problem files</span>
    </h5>

    <p>
      These files have problems we don't know how to fix. These files will
      automatically be ignored - you can upload the rest of your files and all
      the files without problems will be uploaded just fine.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you think there is nothing wrong with your files,
      <a [strongRoute]="contactUs.route">{{ contactUs.label }}</a>,
      and we will investigate.
    </p>

    @if (hasError('invalidExtension')) {
      <p>
        Some files have invalid extensions, these may not be audio files.
        Supported file types include: mp3, webm, ogg, flac, and wav. Convert the
        files to a supported file type, and re-upload.
      </p>
    }

    @if (corruptedFile) {
      <p>
        Some files are corrupted, check against the original copy to determine if
        it was an upload error. If this was an upload error, re-upload it.
      </p>
    }

    @if (hasError('duplicateFile') || hasError('duplicateFileInHarvest')) {
      <p>
        Some files are duplicates of previously uploaded files indicating an
        accidental upload. You should go back to the upload stage and delete the
        duplicates.<br />If you have duplicates in <i>Site A</i> and in
        <i>Site B</i> we'll reject both. We don't know for sure which site they're
        meant to be in.
      </p>
    }

    @if (hasError('overlappingFiles') || hasError('overlappingFilesInHarvest')) {
      <p>
        Some recordings are overlapping other recordings. This may be a sign of
        accidentally setting the wrong site on a folder, or a fault in the
        recording sensor.
