<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
  We have a special process for uploading large amounts of audio data into our
  website.
</p>

<p>
  For our users, this allows you to submit your recorded environment audio for
  analysis and view the results directly through the website.
</p>

<p>Our upload process does several important tasks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It converts audio files to formats compatible with our website</li>
  <li>It checks audio files for errors and attempts to repair them</li>
  <li>
    It gathers metadata about the audio (format, channels, bitrate, sample rate,
    duration, etc...) from the files
  </li>
  <li>It lets us chose which site or point audio is added to</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This upload process can take a while, but you can pause and resume whenever
  you like. We will guide you through this process.
</p>

<p>There are two ways to upload data, either:</p>

<ol>
  <li>As a batch of data you're copying from memory cards or other storage</li>
  <li>Streaming uploads from a remote sensor</li>
</ol>

<p>Which do you want to do?</p>
