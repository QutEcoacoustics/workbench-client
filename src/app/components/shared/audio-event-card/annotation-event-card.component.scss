// There used to be a spectrogram component bug where the spectrograms initial
// inline-flex size would be the default size of the html <canvas> element.
// This would make all of the spectrograms a uniform size.
// However, this bug was fixed and then the spectrograms "stretch" sizing could
// correctly shrink to match its container size. However, this meant that the
// spectrogram would stretch to the size of the card title (because it was the
// the widest element in the card).
// So that all of the spectrograms are a uniform size again, I set the axes
// size to the old size when the spectrogram was based off the default <canvas>
// size (because that is the shape I initially designed the UI around).

  // I am trialing using content-visibility so that spectrograms down the page
  // don't have to paint until the user starts to scroll.
  // This should improve the initial page load and responsiveness.
  // However, it does have the possibility to create lag when scrolling because
  // content will be painted on scroll.
  //
  // To see what this does, enable "show paints" in the Chrome dev tools
  // "layers" tab.
  //
  // If this proves to be bad for UX, we should revert this change.
